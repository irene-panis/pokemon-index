## Description

Playing Pokemon for the first time can be confusing at times when it comes to what pokemon to use for battle and getting a hang of what types are effective against others. With this application, users will have access to a Pokedex (a catalog of pokemon) that contains all current existing pokemon with their own types and relevant information a player needs to know as they progress through any pokemon game, such as evolution requirements, effectiveness in battle, game debuts, region origin, etc. With this app you will also be able to create tags of 6 pokemon maximum for a team, save these teams, and be presented with what types your team is effective and weak against.
